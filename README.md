lightweight and easy to use dynamic adapter.

basically it's a more intuitive way to add different types of views into
listviews, than regular 'moar adapterz' approach. and it can improve your experience
of dealing with one-typed adapters too!

simple example app is in `chumroll-example` module.

i also use it in my project [phclient](https://github.com/cab404/phclient), where it proved itself reliable.

to use it just add `compile 'com.cab404:chumroll:1.1.4'` to your module dependencies

if you want to use it with RecyclerView or ViewPager, then add `compile 'com.cab404:chumroll-proxies:1.1.4'` as well
