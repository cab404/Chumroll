chumroll
========

lightweight and easy to use dynamic adapter.

basically it's a more intuitive way to add different types of views into
listviews, than regular 'moar adapterz' approach. and it can improve your experience
of dealing with one-typed adapters too!

pumpkins and overpowered anthro dogs are not included.

simple example app is in `chumroll-example` module.
i also use it in my project [phclient](https://github.com/cab404/phclient), where it proved itself reliable.

to use it just add `compile 'com.cab404:chumroll:1.0'` to your module dependencies

if that still doesn't work, then include `maven { url "http://dl.bintray.com/cab404/maven" }` in your repository list
